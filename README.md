## Overview

The Real-Time Bus Tracking project aims to provide a modern, user-friendly, and real-time bus tracking solution that allows users to track the location of buses on a map. This system enhances the public transportation experience by providing accurate bus locations and estimated arrival times. The Google Maps API is integrated to display and interact with the maps.

The project also features a chatbot integrated with NLP and ML capabilities to answer user queries, provide route information, and offer a more personalized experience to users.

## Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for designing and styling the user interface.
- **React**: Developed the front-end interface and real-time map tracking.
- **Express**: Built the backend server for handling API requests and managing data.
- **MongoDB**: Used for storing and managing bus route data.
- **Socket.io**: Enabled real-time communication between the server and clients.
- **Google Maps API**: Integrated for displaying and interacting with maps.
- **Azure**: Deployed the application on Azure cloud services for scalability and reliability.
- **NLP and ML**: Utilized Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning for the chatbot functionality.
